# San-Francisco-Airbnb-listings-overview

## Libraries used
For this project Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries were installed and used. 

## Motivation for the project
The project was done using the Airbnb listings in San Francisco to help understand
1. Which neighborhoods have the highest rating scores?
2. Which are the most common property types in San Francisco?
3. What factors affect the listings prices in San Francisco?

## Files in the repository
The files in the repository includes the listings San Francisco dataset and jupyter notebook. The listings dataset contains raw data obtained from the Kaggle website. The jupyter notebook contains the project code as well as the analysis results and outputs. 

## Summary of the results of the analysis
From the analysis we found that: There is plenty good neighborhoods one can stay in. Even so, there are some types of properties that are limited like cabins if you are looking for such adventure. You would need to plan early to access such. If you would like to get more reviews as a host you can consider being a super-host.
